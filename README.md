# Bi-Lipschitz-Neural-Network

This Github repository contains the codes for ["A provable control of sensitivity of neural networks through a direct parameterization of the overall bi-Lipschitzness"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09821), accepted at NeurIPS 2024.

BLNN.py includes a skeleton of our model BLNN and PBLNN. 
For an effective implementation of Theorem 3.7 for more efficient backpropagation, we recommend to incorporate this skeleton into the DEQ framework [https://github.com/locuslab/deq](https://github.com/locuslab/deq).
